    In im.events you will find event handling functions and chains. Besides providing a cross browser wrapping API for standard events, IM also implements 'mouseenter', 'mouseleave' and <a href="#" class="doc-link" doc-path="api.events.functions.live">im.live</a> which can capture (bubbling) events without needing to attach event handlers to the elements itself.
