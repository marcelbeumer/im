    IM (also known as 'Ieniemienie') is a small and lightweight JavaScript library that focuses on code performance and developer productivity. It allows writing compact, readable JavaScript providing a simple API for most common tasks such as DOM traversal, event handling, CSS property manipulation/animation, CSS selectors, and much more. IM consists of &lt; 2000 lines of code, 6.6KB minified and gzipped.

    IM could be considered being a 'jQuery light' (as jQuery does a lot more but also with many more lines of code), with the addition of a few unique features that do not exist in jQuery. Most the IM API is the same or very similar to the jQuery API. As such, migrating code from IM to jQuery (and vise versa) should be rather easy. IM functions are documented inline in such a detail, that the source itself serve as documentation.
